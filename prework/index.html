	<h2>Vicky Phung</h2>
	<h3> Hello! </h3>
	<p> I'm Vicky. I was born and raised in Nothern Virginia, but also call D.C. home. 
		<br>I love my family and two dogs. I completed my bachelor's degree in Conflict Analysis and Resolution,
		<br>from The Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution, at George Mason University, in Fairfax, VA.
		<br>I've always wanted to solve problems and help people communicate. I aspire to do this, and more, through 
		<br>software engineering and am eager to begin my career!<br><br>
